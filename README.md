# monte_carlo
Monte carlo retirement simulator with Python

Using the Monte Carlo Simulation to test the probability of having enough at retirement or going broke based on historical returns of stocks and bond.

The program let's one input investment types (bonds, stocks or a mix of both), starting amount of money, how much withdrawal one takes each year, minimum, most-likely and maximum years in retirement.

Program runs through different amount of cases with different starting points in time (default 50 000) and returns odds of running out of money, minimum, average and maximum amount of money based on the simulations. Lastly the program creates a bar chart of simulations (plotting only first 3000 for efficiency).

Python, files, matplotlib, looping
